# Ping Pong  
A simple Ping Pong game built entirely in **C**, designed to implement and reinforce the graphics programming concepts I learned while studying the book **“LearnOpenGL”**.

---

### Purpose  
This project marks my first hands-on experience with **OpenGL**. After reading *LearnOpenGL*, I wanted to move beyond just theory and create something interactive from scratch. This game was my way of experimenting with rendering, input handling, shaders, and real-time updates—all in low-level C.



###  Tools & Libraries Used  
- **OpenGL** – Core graphics rendering and pipeline control  
- **GLFW** – Window creation, context management, and keyboard input  
- **GLAD** – OpenGL function loader to interface with GPU features  



### Features  
- Classic two-player Ping Pong gameplay  
- Real-time paddle movement and collision detection   
- Clean rendering with double buffering



### Future Improvements  
- Add a basic AI opponent for single-player mode  
- Implement pause, reset, and restart functionalities  
- Add sound effects and basic UI using bitmap fonts  
- Improve collision physics and ball behavior  
- Use shaders more extensively for effects and transitions
